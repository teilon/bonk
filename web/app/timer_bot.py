"""
Simple Bot to send timed Telegram messages.

This Bot uses the Application class to handle the bot and the JobQueue to send
timed messages.

First, a few handler functions are defined. Then, those functions are passed to
the Application and registered at their respective places.
Then, the bot is started and runs until we press Ctrl-C on the command line.

Usage:
Basic Alarm Bot example, sends a message after a set time.
Press Ctrl-C on the command line or send a signal to the process to stop the
bot.
